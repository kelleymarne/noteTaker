## Description

> Challenge #11 Note Taker

## Introduction 
This week we were told to create an app using Express JS that allows you to take a note and store it to access later. We needed to use Express JS to connect the backend with the pre-coded front end.

## Challenges
This assignment was a little bit more challenging for me because this is a very verbose portion of the class. It was a little bit complex to figure out how to lay out this assignment. Up until now we have had about 3-4 different pages of code that we've written. Its been very straight forward, such as an HTML, CSS, 1-2 JS pages, and maybe a JSON file. This was harder to wrap my head around because we have so many different files for API routes, HTML routes, JS pages for each portion, as well as the HTML, CSS, and JSON pages. Hopefully over time this will become more natural to understand.

## Victories

I was really excited to get the DELETE route to work. I know it wasn't required, but i was really looking forward to pushing myself to get this one figured out. My tutor helped me work on the GET and POST route, and after our session from what we went over, combined with going back in the lessons that we did in class and independantly i was able to get that DELETE route working no problem.
